# AsyncPhotos iOS(Swift)
Simple example of how to asynchronously load, cancel, and cache images loaded from the network.

This is a Swift implementation of a collection view with canceling image loads.

(Uses the gist at: https://gist.github.com/ajjames/3863a5bf516175f8d33f 
To implement yourself, you need the following files:
- UIImageView-Extension.swift
- Downloader.swift
- ImageManager.swift
)

Other misc features:
- UIImageView-Extension.swift: offers example of how to support stored properties in extensions.
- DispatchUtility.swift: offers a simplified means of dispatching to GCD.
